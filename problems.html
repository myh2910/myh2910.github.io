			<li>Let \(\Gamma\) be the circumcircle of acute-angled triangle \(ABC\). Points \(D\) and \(E\) lie on segments \(AB\) and \(AC\), respectively, such that \(AD=AE\). The perpendicular bisectors of \(BD\) and \(CE\) intersect the minor arcs \(AB\) and \(AC\) of \(\Gamma\) at points \(F\) and \(G\), respectively. Prove that the lines \(DE\) and \(FG\) are parallel (or are the same line).</li>
			<li>Find all integers \(n\ge 3\) for which there exist real numbers \(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{n+2}\), such that \(a_{n+1}=a_1\) and \(a_{n+2}=a_2\), and \[a_ia_{i+1}+1=a_{i+2}\] for \(i=1,2,\dots,n\).</li>
			<li>An <i>anti-Pascal</i> triangle is an equilateral triangular array of numbers such that, except for the numbers in the bottom row, each number is the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers immediately below it. For example, the following array is an anti-Pascal triangle with four rows which contains every integer from \(1\) to \(10\).<br><img class="latexcenter" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/a/4/4a4607074647a93496d7428f5ce2b8489539b704.png" alt="\[\begin{array}{

			<li style="counter-increment: list-counter 4;">A <i>site</i> is any point \((x,y)\) in the plane such that \(x\) and \(y\) are both positive integers less than or equal to \(20\).<br><br>Initially, each of the \(400\) sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns placing stones with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red stones is not equal to \(\sqrt{5}\). On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any other occupied site.) They stop as soon as a player cannot place a stone.<br><br>Find the greatest \(K\) such that Amy can ensure that she places at least \(K\) red stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.</li>
			<li>Let \(a_1,a_2,\dots\) be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Suppose that there is an integer \(N&gt; 1\) such that, for each \(n\ge N\), the number \[\frac{a_1}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_3}+\dots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}+\frac{a_n}{a_1}\] is an integer. Prove that there is a positive integer \(M\) such that \(a_m=a_{m+1}\) for all \(m\ge M\).</li>

			<li>Let \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\) be a sequence of positive real numbers that satisfies \[a_1=1\quad\text{and}\quad a^2_{n+1}+a_{n+1}=a_n\quad\text{for every natural number }n.\] Prove that \(a_n\ge\frac1n\) for every natural number \(n\).</li>
			<li>Ziquan makes a drawing in the plane for art class. He starts by placing his pen at the origin, and draws a series of line segments, such that the \(n^{th}\) line segment has length \(n\). He is not allowed to lift his pen, so that the end of the \(n^{th}\) segment is the start of the \((n+1)^{th}\) segment. Line segments drawn are allowed to intersect and even overlap previously drawn segments.<br><br>After drawing a finite number of line segments, Ziquan stops and hands in his drawing to his art teacher. He passes the course if the drawing he hands in is an \(N\) by \(N\) square, for some positive integer \(N\), and he fails the course otherwise. Is it possible for Ziquan to pass the course?</li>
			<li>Let \(S\) be a set of \(n\ge 3\) positive real numbers. Show that the largest possible number of distinct integer powers of three that can be written as the sum of three distinct elements of \(S\) is \(n-2\).</li>
			<li>A circle is inscribed in a rhombus \(ABCD\). Points \(P\) and \(Q\) vary on line segments \(\seg{AB}\) and \(\seg{AD}\), respectively, so that \(\seg{PQ}\) is tangent to the circle. Show that for all such line segments \(\seg{PQ}\), the area of triangle \(CPQ\) is constant.</li>
			<li>A purse contains a finite number of coins, each with distinct positive integer values. Is it possible that there are exactly \(2020\) ways to use coins from the purse to make the value \(2020\)?</li>
